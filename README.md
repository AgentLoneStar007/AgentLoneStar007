### About Me
Hi. I'm AgentLoneStar007, or Agent, for short. I'm an evangelical disciple of Jesus, and I
love computers and pretty much anything to do with them; especially networking. I pretty much
love anything supporting an electric current(although I'm not overly fond of website development).

I also love science, chemistry, math, physics, and most things complicated.
Oh, and I hate philosophy. 

My favorite game is Minecraft Java Edition, but I also enjoy playing Garry's Mod, No Man's Sky,
and the occasional random Steam game. I also enjoy editing videos for my channel, and playing
with my best fried Ravencross15(has Github profile, but doesn't use it really, so no link).

### Experience in Languages/Softwares
Below I have listed my experience in individual languages and programming-related items.
Next to them is a 1-5 star rating of my confidence using the item. One star means I have learned it,
but not actively used it. Five stars means I use it constantly and am very confident using it.

    <summary>More Info</summary>
    <br>
    I have been daily-driving EndeavourOS(an Arch-based distro) on my<br>
    main PC since about 2021, but I've been using Linux for random<br>
    projects since long before. I am not, by far, a professional Linux<br>
    user, but I do know my way around the terminal/shell.

    <summary>More Info</summary>
    <br>
    Python is the first language I ever learned, way back since 2015.<br>
    I've used it for pretty much everything that doesn't recquire use<br>
    of a different language.
