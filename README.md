My gamertag is AgentLoneStar007, or Agent for short. 
I'm a Christian, I love computers, and anything to 
do with them, I like complex things, I like space, 
I like gaming, I like making and editing videos, and
I like programming.

Speaking of which, I program in HTML, CSS, JS, and Python.
I hope to eventually add Java and C or C# to my reputar.
